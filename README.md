## Description:

Hey my name is Jackson Willis and this is my coding portfolio. On this webpage you can get to know me and check out projects I have worked on.  

At the top of the webpage you will find a navbar with links to different sections on the page such as "About Me", "Projects", and "Contacts".

Below the navbar I put up some image links that will take you to the pages of some of my projects.

Below the image links you will see the "About Me" section that gives a brief description about well.. me

Scroll down a little farther and you will see some icons displaying the languages im familiar with and just below that are the links to the repos of my projects

At the very bottom you will find the "Contacts" which are links to my GitHub and Email etc.
